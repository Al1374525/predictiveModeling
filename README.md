# Ridge Regression on California Housing Dataset

## Overview

This project involves building and evaluating a Ridge Regression model to predict housing prices using the California Housing Dataset. The dataset contains various features related to housing in California, such as median income, average number of rooms, and house age. The goal is to accurately predict the median house value based on these features.

## Dataset

The California Housing Dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module. It contains 20,640 samples and 8 numerical features. The target variable is `MedHouseVal`, representing the median house value for California districts.

### Features

- `MedInc`: Median income in block group
- `HouseAge`: Median house age in block group
- `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household
- `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household
- `Population`: Block group population
- `AveOccup`: Average number of household members
- `Latitude`: Block group latitude
- `Longitude`: Block group longitude

### Target

- `MedHouseVal`: Median house value in block group (in $100,000s)

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script containing code for loading the data, preprocessing, training the Ridge Regression model, and evaluating the results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy (for statistical plots)

## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
